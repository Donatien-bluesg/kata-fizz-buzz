# Instructions
Write a program that prints one line for each number from 1 to N with following rules:

- Usually just print the number itself.
- For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print `Buzz` instead of the number
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz` instead of the number

## Example
```
5: "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz"
```
